            I get it. Everyone is buying these now after years of not caring about Stanley tumblers because of social media.
            The problem with viral crap like this is we get caught up in fitting in and jumping on the band wagon that we
            fail to see what's wrong with a product before buying it. THIS TUMBLER IS NOT LEAK PROOF. It's not even a little
            resistent to leaking. Even if you have the top fully closed and the straw taken out, the liquid inside will
            leak out like crazy if you tip it over even slightly. To me, if I'm going to carry around 30-40oz of hot or
            cold liquids then the tumbler MUST prevent said liquids from coming out. I understand it's not a water bottle,
            but that's a lame technicality that Stanley shouldn't cling to. At a MINIMUM the tumbler should be leak proof
            if I take out the straw and close the top. Furthermore, the sip top closing mechanism seems very flimsy
            and can be easily bended out of place, so beware of turning it too hard or especially dropping your tumbler.
            I am highly disappointed for being sucked into thinking this was a reliable tumbler that would replace others
            I have. Granted they are not as nice looking, but they do the job of holding AND containing the water I take
            with me all day to and from work in NYC.
            I do NOT recommend this tumbler and I would suggest that Stanley fix these important issues instead of
            focusing on more colors and patterns.""".stripIndent();
